    <!-- Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action)
         when the form is submitted.

        Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the 
        request and response headers.

        Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the 
        field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form
         data. -->

            <input type='text' /> 
            <button>Submit</button>
